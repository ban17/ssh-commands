# ssh-commands
Bash commands for easier synchronizing with web server over ssh  
Program using __rsync__ command for synchronization, but interface is easier for reading and commands are shorter  
We stopped using filezilla for managing file transfers since we started using this set of scripts  
Some advantages comparing to programs like Filezilla are:
* You can make change in different directories and then upload all them together without checking what files are changed
* It's git friendly, you can use existing .gitignore files to exclude specific files and directories
* You can easy add other specific rules for ignoring files from upload/download

## Setup
This scripts are not just "copy/paste" you need some additional work to setup them but it will worth :)  

Best way to use this scripts is:  
1. Create aliases for ssh servers
2. Add scripts to $PATH
3. Set public key for login without password
